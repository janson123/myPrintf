# myPrintf


This was another teaser exercise.

This is a personal primitive  implementation of printf.



A simple way to test this is to compile myprintf and test together and then run the executable.


Ex) gcc myprintf.c test.c -o exec



Test is just a C file that calls the myprintf function from myprintf.c, and prints out various statements. myprintf can handle strings, hex, and integers.
